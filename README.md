## Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato restaurant data to identify the key drivers of restaurant success. By analyzing ratings, cuisines, and location-based trends, the project provides actionable insights for restaurant owners and food-tech stakeholders to optimize their market presence.

## Key Performance Values
Target Rating Range: Most successful restaurants cluster between 3.5 and 4.5.
Service Impact: Restaurants offering Online Ordering and Table Booking show a statistically higher average rating compared to those that do not.
Volume Correlation: A direct positive correlation exists between the number of votes (customer engagement) and the final rating score.
Primary Cuisines: North Indian, Chinese, and South Indian dominate the market share.

## Analysis Workflow
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized restaurant names and locations.
Feature Engineering: Categorized "Cost for Two" into budget segments and extracted service availability flags.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Distribution analysis of ratings.
Mapping restaurant density by geographic location (e.g., Banashankari, Indiranagar).
Comparison of "Online Order" vs. "Rating" performance.
Visualization: Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create heatmaps, distribution plots, and correlation matrices.

## Strategic Insights for Business
Digital Transformation: Enabling digital touchpoints (online orders/booking) is the most efficient way to increase customer reach and rating stability.

Market Saturation: High-density areas require "Casual Dining" quality or unique niche cuisines to stand out against the saturated "Quick Bites" market.

Engagement Loops: Encouraging customer "votes" is critical, as high engagement volume acts as social proof, driving the rating higher over time.
